# Game Development Portfolio

Welcome to my Game Development Portfolio! I'm a passionate self-taught game developer who has been working with Unity for nearly two years. I enjoy every moment of the creative process and problem-solving that game development offers.

## About Me

As an online student and self-taught programmer, I've dedicated myself to learning the ins and outs of game development. My journey has been filled with challenges and triumphs, and I'm excited to share my projects and progress with you.

## Current Focus

- ðŸŽ® **Game Programming Patterns:** I'm constantly exploring and implementing best practices in game programming to improve my code and create efficient and maintainable game systems.

- ðŸ§  **Game Systems:** Developing game systems, including state machines, to enhance gameplay and make my games more engaging and interactive.

- ðŸ’» **Code Quality:** I'm committed to writing clean, well-organized, and optimized code to create games that run smoothly and are easy to maintain.

## Portfolio

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Project 1: Temporal Tunnels](https://aesaire.itch.io/temporal-tunnels) - This was a submission to the Mini Jame Jam #21. Me and my team created a time-based platformer game, featuring a constantly repeating loop and a fun soundtrack!

- [Project 2: Mr. Stickman- Office Simulator](link-to-project-2) - This was a submission to the Mini Jame Jam #16. Me and my team created a simple office-themed simulator, featuring a character called "Mr. Stickman", who's tired of his boring, generic, office job.
