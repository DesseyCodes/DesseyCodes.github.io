            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As an online student and a self-taught programmer, I've found a passion for game development! For almost a year now, I've been working through trial and error with Unity (and I've enjoyed every second of the battle!).

            <h2>Game Jams and Collaborations</h2>
            <p>
                I'm constantly searching for game jams to show off my skills, gain more skills, build up a portfolio, as well as fellow game developers. If you know of any jams, or have a team in need of a programmer, don't be afraid to reach out! 🤜🏾💥🤛
